## Root Cause

This issue exists due to not using parametrised queries. Only the usage of prepared statements or stored procedures with non-dynamic and 
previously bound parameters (“parametrised query”) can prevent SQL injection attacks.

## Fix

All software versions up to and including version 2.47.23.05 are affected. The vendor was informed of the finding on May 5, 2023. The vulnerability is fixed with version 2.47.23.06.
